* Note if you can't read everything
change your gui scale

Right now there is a bug in the menu where if you want to go back it will go back
to the main menu. If you don't want to go to the menu press esc instead!


---Important features you should know---
  
- Mobs will despawn if they have armour or an item in their hand. To stop them from despawning you need to nametag them!
This is becauses entities are the largest causes of lag.
- If you name tag a mob "Silence Me" they won't make any more noises!
- Make sure to put your cape in the cape slot so that you don't loose it!
- Shift right clicking an Armor Stand and a Straw Statue with a stick will open up a gui to configure the armour stand!
- To put an item in an item frame you need to press shift then right click. Then to remove it don't shift!
- There is a world border at 20,000 blocks (overworld)
- Enhance your netherite gear with a gem found underground in certain biomes
- You can use shaders but be warned one of the mods is incompatable so you may see some glitches
- The server is compatable with VR! There is a vr change button on the home screen to switch. The mod is only installed
so that you can see VR people's movements.
- The only two mods disabled in the modpack is Litematica and Replay Mod. Both are included and can be renabled.
- You can sharpen your tools on a grindstone!
- If you rename an item it won't despawn if you drop it!
- A reindeer is a flying alternative to the elytra
- You can now interact with fletching tables
- Using signs, you can notify people when they enter your area
- In your inventory there is a button that gives you an in-game wiki for 2 mods!
